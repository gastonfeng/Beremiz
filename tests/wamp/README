Crossbar test router configuration is available in .crossbar directory.

Starting command:
crossbar start

This project contains wamp client config to be loaded at runtime startup.

project_files/wampconf.json

wampconf.json is in "Project Files", so it is copied to runtime's working directory, and then loaded after program transfer + runtime restart.

Otherwise, wamp config file path can be forced :
./Beremiz_service.py -c /path/to/my/wampconf.json /working/dir

Otherwise, path for CRA secret can be forced :
./Beremiz_service.py -s /path/to/my/secret /working/dir
