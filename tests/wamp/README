This project contains wamp client config to be loaded at runtime startup.  

project_files/wampconf.json

wampconf.json is in "Project Files", so it is copied to runtime's working directory, and then loaded after program transfer + runtime restart.

Otherwise, wamp config file path can be forced :
./Beremiz_service.py -c  /path/to/my/wampconf.json /working/dir

Crossbar test router configuration is available in .crossbar directory. Start with :
crossbar -d start
